                            Hindu Rajput ruler of Mewar, a region in north-western India in the present day state of
                            Rajasthan. He belonged to the Sisodiya sept of Rajputs. In popular Indian culture, Pratap is
                            considered to exemplify the qualities like bravery and chivalry to which Rajputs aspire,
                            especially in context of his opposition to the Mughal emperor Akbar.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In 1568, during the reign of Udai Singh II, Chittor was conquered by the
                            Mughal Emperor Akbar after the third Jauhar at Chittor. However, Udai Singh and the royal
                            family of Mewar escaped before the capture of the fort and moved to the foothills of the
                            Aravalli Range where Udai Singh founded the city of Udaipur in 1559. Rana Udai Singh had
                            wished Jagmal, his son, from her favorite - the Bhatiyani queen to succeed him. But after
                            his death the senior nobles wanted Pratap, the eldest son, to be their king as was
                            customary. During the coronation ceremony, Jagmal was physically moved out of the palace by
                            the Chundawat Chief and Tomar chief Ramshah and prevailed upon Pratap, who was crowned as
                            the next Rana of Mewar. Folklore has it that Pratap did not want to go against the wishes of
                            his father but Rajput nobles convinced him that Jagmal was not fit to rule in the troubled
                            times of the day; but it is quite possible that what occurred was a bitterly contested
                            struggle for succession: something characteristic of most South Asian kingdoms of the age.

                            Though the chief reasons for resentment between Pratap Singh and Akbar is unclear, it is now
                            largely agreed that it had to do with disagreements over the status of Mewar within the
                            Mughal Empire, were it to at all accept Mughal suzerainty. The tensions were further
                            characterised by the fact that Babur and Rana Sanga, grandfathers to Akbar and Pratap
                            respectively, had earlier bitterly contested the control over the Gangetic plains and the
                            Doab. It is evident that there had been some measures of reconciliation, such as acceptance
                            of ambassadors and representatives between the two courts. However, none of these could ever
                            be taken to any logical end.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Maharana Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident. He died
                            at Chavand, which served as his capital, on 29 January 1597, aged fifty-seven. A chhatri,
                            commemorating Pratap Singh's funeral, exists in Chavand and is an important tourist
                            attraction today. It is said that as he lay dying, Pratap made his son and successor, Amar
                            Singh, swear to maintain eternal conflict against the Mughals. Amar Singh fought 17 wars
                            with the Mughals. After Mewar was depleted financially and in man-power he conditionally
                            accepted them as rulers. The treaty between Amar Singh and Mughal King Jahangir had some
                            obligations that fort of Chittor would not be repaired and Mewar would have to keep a
                            contingent of 1000 horse in the Mughal service. Besides Amar Singh would not have to be
                            present at any of the Mughal Darbars..</p>
